//! Text recognition with the OCR engine built into the operating system.
//!
//! - Windows: `Windows.Media.Ocr`, using the OCR language packs installed for the user's
//!   languages.
//! - macOS: Vision's accurate text recognition, whose languages ship with the OS.
//! - Linux: Tesseract, loaded at run time from the system's `libtesseract`, with the language data
//!   the user installed. Without the library, recognizing returns [`Error::NotInstalled`].
//! - Elsewhere: no engine, so [`is_available`] is `false` and recognizing returns
//!   [`Error::Unavailable`].
//!
//! Recognition blocks, so call it from a worker thread in a GUI app.
